# A central authority

A single source of truth. Optimizing for consistency across a group. Everyone is looking at the same data and see's the same things.

## CRDTs

<sub>

Allow for distributing state across multiple peers, enabling direct peer to peer communication.

</sub>

-v-

## Lower server load

Distributed architecture spreads most of the load of real time updates off of the backend service and onto individual clients.


-v-

## Faster update times

Provides direct p2p updates.

-v-

## Supports End to End encryption

<sub>

Peers can encrypt all of their data, preventing other clients that do not have a key from reading updates.

</sub>


-v-

## More complicated to secure

<sub>

CRDTs don't provide any guarantees about who is allowed to make updates, and without a central authority to authenticate transactions, preventing unauthorized access and updates can be complicated.
