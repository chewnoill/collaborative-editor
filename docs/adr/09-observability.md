# Observability with New Relic

## Status

Accepted

Dashboard is setup here: https://onenr.io/0OQMOrODPRG

## Context

Are my systems functioning?  Do my systems have sufficient resources available? Do my customers know if my system is down and have a bad experience?  How can I monitor which peers are connected to each other?  How can I monitor what data is being passed between clients?

Observibility in a cloud service is about answering these questions and more. Tooling around tracing and debugging how information flows through the system.
