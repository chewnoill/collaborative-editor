# Document Site with Docusaurus

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Use Docusaurus to publish internal documentation to increase visibility and external participation.


## Decision & Consequences

This allows for documentation to be included directly with the source code it is documenting,
while also publishing it next to the application that is being documented.
Some additional resources will be needed to keep documentation up to date.
